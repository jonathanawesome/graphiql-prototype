# graphiql-v2-prototype

There's much to do on the [path to GraphiQL v2](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/issues/2328) and the new [design proposal](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/discussions/2216) is centered around an effort to combine Docs and Docs Explorer into a single interface.

Inspired by the work of, and using many lines of code written by, [stonexer](https://github.com/stonexer) and their [graphql-picker](https://github.com/stonexer/graphiql-picker) demo, I thought I'd pitch in and build it out as best as I could so the community can have some buttons to click and flows to go through. 

This prototype uses [Ladle](https://ladle.dev/) and the primary goal is to test the design proposal...you can see the whole kit [here](https://jonathanawesome.github.io/graphiql-v2-prototype/?mode=preview&story=reference-app--reference-app). The root Ladle UI is [here](https://jonathanawesome.github.io/graphiql-v2-prototype/).
